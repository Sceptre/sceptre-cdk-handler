# This is an example of deploying the CDK stack using the "bootstrapless" deployment_type. This is
# the more "Sceptre-like" way to configure your stacks. You can "wire together" other stacks into
# this one using resolvers to populate values in the bootstrapless_config, parameters, and
# sceptre_user_data. By default, the profile or role doing the deployments will also be used to push
# the file and image assets.
template:
  type: cdk
  # The path is always within your project's templates/ directory.

  # bootstrapless_config are the snake_cased arguments passed to the cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer
  # for definitions of possible parameters, see the API docs here:

  bootstrapless_config:
    # You can use !stack_attr to reference other stack attributes that happen
    # to be set with resolvers to chain the resolver value. It makes sense to use the
    # same bucket as Sceptre uses for its template uploads for your file assets.
    file_asset_bucket_name: !stack_attr template_bucket_name
    # It can be useful to apply the same prefix as your template_key_prefix to ensure your
    # assets are namespaced similarly to the rest of Sceptre's uploaded artifacts.

  # You can also pass CDK context key/value pairs. If you don't specify a context, the default
  # context will be used (as determined by CDK). If you specify the context on the StackGroup config
  # you can reference it via Jinja2 syntax like below.
  context: {{cdk_context}}

# Parameters are DEPLOY-TIME values passed to the CloudFormation template. Your CDK stack construct
# needs to have CfnParameters in order to support this, though.

# sceptre_user_data is passed to your Stack Class's constructor for supplying values at COMPILE-TIME.
