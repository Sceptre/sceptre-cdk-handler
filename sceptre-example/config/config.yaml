# If you use an iam_role, it will be the default role used to deploy when using the bootstrapless
# deployment_type (unless a different role is specified in the bootstrapless_config). If using the
# "bootstrapped" deployment_type with an iam_role, that role will first be assumed and then CDK will
# assume the bootstrapped roles for pushing image assets. The iam_role will always be used for
# actually deploying the synthesized stack templates, however.
